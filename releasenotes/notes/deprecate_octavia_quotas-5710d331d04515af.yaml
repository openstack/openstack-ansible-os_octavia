    Quota management for Octavia service has been deperecated in favor of
    centralized approach through ``openstack.osa.openstack_resources``
    playbook.
    As default project name was ``service``, defining quota inside of the
    Octavia role was causing conflicts with other services (like Trove).

    Respective variables were deprecated and have no effect:

      * octavia_num_instances
      * octavia_ram
      * octavia_gigabytes
      * octavia_num_server_groups
      * octavia_num_server_group_members
      * octavia_num_cores
      * octavia_num_secgroups
      * octavia_num_ports
      * octavia_num_security_group_rules
      * octavia_num_volumes

    Please reffer to `Octavia documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible-os_octavia/latest/configure-octavia.html>`_
    for more information how to manage service quotas.
